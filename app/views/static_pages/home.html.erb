            <h2 class= "subtitle">It's easy as 1, 1.5, 2, 3</h2>
            <p class="step">
                <i>Step 1:</i>
            </p>
            <p class="process">
                 Sign Up as either a Mentor or a Mentee/Protege on our Veteran, Student, or Entrepreneur network.

            <p class="step">
                <i>Step 1.5:</i>
            </p>
            <p class="process">
                 (Optional) Specify the free spots on your weekly schedule and your preferred way of communicating. This is completely optional but it helps us find better Mentor/Mentee  matches.
            </p>
            <p class="step">
                <i>Step 2:</i>
            </p>
            <p class="process">
                 After your account is created, you can view our automatically generated list of suggestions (A list of Mentors if you're a Mentee and a list of Mentees if you're a Mentor) as well as
                do manual searches based on different criteria.
            </p>
            <p class="step">
                <i>Step 3:</i>
            </p>
            <p class="process">
                 When you find and connect to a good match, the contact information for each user is exchanged. From there, you have
                complete freedom to plan and educate. Allons-y!

            <h1 class="title">Frequently Answered Questions</h1>
         
            <p class="question">
                How is this different than other places to learn from?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                What makes MM diferent from tutoring centers is that we take both the mentor and the mentee's
                schedules and preferences into account when making matches. Most tutoring centers restrict each
                party's schedule to the office's hours. Mentor Mentored is also over the internet, meaning that someone
                from Florida can mentor someone from New Jersey just as easily as someone else from Florida. Lastly,
                anybody can sign up as a Mentor in any subject, so 
            </p>

            <p class="question">
                What if I want to tutor someone?
            </p>

            <p class="answer">
                We use the term "mentor" because it encompasses all forms of education and guidance. Whether you want to
                tutor, advise, mentor, or train someone, Mentor Mentored will find you somebody to help.
